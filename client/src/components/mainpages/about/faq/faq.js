            <b>What is CBD?</b>

CBD is short for cannabidiol, or one of the chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant. They interact with what’s known in the human body as the endocannabinoid system, which plays many regulation roles throughout the body including appetite, metabolism, memory and much more. It’s not magic, but it’s pretty close.

            <b>What is the difference between hemp derived CBD products and marijuana products?</b>

Marijuana products are mainly differentiated from hemp derived CBD products in that they contain higher levels of THC, which is the psychoactive compound responsible for the “high” effect among other others. So you get the benefits of the Cannabis plant without any of the side effects.

            <b>Will these products get me high?</b>

No! Our products have been filtered to contain less than 0.3% THC, so they will not produce a high.

            <b>Can these products help with stress & anxiety?</b>

There is no way to guarantee that these products will cure stress & anxiety. However, among the most common uses for CBD products is to alleviate everyday stresses and promote a sense of calm. Due to the way our neurotransmitters are wired, the endocannabinoid system may play a role in the regulation of our response to stress. However, with that being said, everybody’s body chemistry is different so experiences with our CBD products may vary.

            <b>What are some general CBD effects?</b>

Due to the variety of ways in which products are ingested, they may have varying times of absorption and how long they last. For example, our vapes are more immediate whereas our edibles may take longer to be ingested. However, users report feeling relaxed, calm, focused, and re-invigorated.

            <b>Will these products help me sleep?</b>

CBD users have been using products to help with maintaining a healthy sleep cycle by ingesting products prior to bed-time.

            <b>Does Herbs & Potions really use magic?</b>

Although magicians should never reveal their secrets, the effects our products product are due to being derived from the Hemp herb. The effects you feel are the cannabinoids within the products interacting with the cannabinoid receptors within your body. They’re so good you’ll think they’re real potions though!
